                For a given signal, the power spectrum gives a plot of the portion of a signal\'s power (energy per unit time) \
                falling within given frequency bins. The most common way of generating a power spectrum is by using a Discrete Fourier Transform, \
                but other techniques such as the maximum entropy method can also be used.\
